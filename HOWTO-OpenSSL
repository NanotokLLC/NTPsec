NTS needs TLS 1.3 or newer.
That was first supported in OpenSSL 1.1.1
  (1.1.1a is broken)
Some OSes/Distros don't support a new enough version of OpenSSL
This file contains notes on how to download, build, and install 1.1.1k
It also works for testing 3.0.0 alpha and beta

It's rough.  Don't be surprised by bugs/oversights.
Corrections, clarifications and feedback encouraged.

Download OpenSSL source from here:
  https://www.openssl.org/source/
  https://www.openssl.org/source/old/1.1.1/

You should be able to cut/paste many of these lines.
But check for the latest versions first.

cd xxx
mkdir OpenSSL
cd OpenSSL
for OpenSSL 1.1.1k
  wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1k.tar.gz
  tar -xzf openssl-1.1.1k.tar.gz
  cd openssl-1.1.1k
for OpenSSL 3.0.0 beta1
  wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.0.0-beta1.tar.gz
  tar -xzf openssl-3.0.0-beta1.tar.gz
  cd openssl-3.0.0-beta1

# Check NOTES.PERL
#   for CentOS, you need
  sudo yum install perl-core
# Fedora 33+34 for 3.0.0-alpha and beta
  # ./config needs
  sudo dnf install perl-FindBin 'perl(IPC::Cmd)' 'perl(File::Compare)'
  # make needs
  # make test needs
  sudo dnf install 'perl(Test::Harness)' 'perl(Test::More)' 'perl(File::Copy)'
  # make install also needs:
  sudo dnf install 'perl(Pod::Html)'
# On FreeBSD for 3.0.0-alpha and beta
  sudo pkg install perl5

On Linux
  ./config --prefix=/usr/local/ssl --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl shared
	enable-des

  cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d

  echo "/usr/local/ssl/lib" > openssl-3.0.0-beta.conf
  ldconfig

On FreeBSD, I couldn't figure out how it is supposed to work.
  Probably, I just need the magic to ldconfig.
  echo "/usr/local/ssl/lib" >> /etc/ld-elf.so.conf
  reboot
or something close to that.

NetBSD:
  echo "/usr/local/ssl/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
(no ldconfig on my search path.  Doesn't seem to be needed.)

# check with
/usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl version

# Note that the directories in the above config line need to
# match where wscript looks for your OS.
# The above works for CentOS 7

Fedora and CentOS 7 need this if you use real certificates:
  nts ca /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt
