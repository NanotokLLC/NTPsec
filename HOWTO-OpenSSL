NTS needs TLS 1.3 or newer.
That was first supported in OpenSSL 1.1.1
  (1.1.1a is broken)
Some OSes/Distros don't support a new enough version of OpenSSL
This file contains notes on how to download, build, and install 1.1.1j
It also works for testing 3.0.0 alpha

It's rough.  Don't be surprised by bugs/oversights.
Corrections, clarifications and feedback encouraged.

Download OpenSSL source from here:
  https://www.openssl.org/source/
  https://www.openssl.org/source/old/1.1.1/

You should be able to cut/paste many of these lines.
But check for the latest versions first.

cd xxx
mkdir OpenSSL
cd OpenSSL
for OpenSSL 1.1.1j
  wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1j.tar.gz
  tar -xzf openssl-1.1.1j.tar.gz
  cd openssl-1.1.1j
for OpenSSL 3.0.0 alpha13
  wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.0.0-alpha13.tar.gz
  tar -xzf openssl-3.0.0-alpha13.tar.gz
  cd openssl-3.0.0-alpha13

# Check NOTES.PERL
#   for CentOS, you need
  sudo yum install perl-core
    Fedora needs
  sudo dnf install perl-IPC-Cmd perl-FindBin perl-File-Compare
For make test on Fedora
  sudo dnf install perl-Test-Harness perl perl-Pod-Html

On Linux
  ./config --prefix=/usr/local/ssl --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl shared
	enable-des
time make
sudo make install

cd /etc/ld.so.conf.d
echo "/usr/local/ssl/lib" > openssl-1.1.1j.conf
echo "/usr/local/ssl/lib" > openssl-3.0.0-alpha.conf
ldconfig

# check with
/usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl version

# Note that the directories in the above config line need to
# match where wscript looks for your OS.
# The above works for CentOS 7

Fedora and CentOS 7 need this if you use real certificates:
  nts ca /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt
